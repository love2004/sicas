# SICAS 5.0 - Simple Explanation

SICAS 5.0 is an advanced AI thinking system that helps you get exactly the type of response you need through adjustable parameters:

## Key Parameters You Can Control:

1. **Detail Level (V)**: From brief summaries (V=0) to in-depth analysis (V=4)
   - V=0: Just the essentials (3-5 sentences)
   - V=1: Brief practical overview (â‰¤250 words)
   - V=2: Comprehensive explanation
   - V=3: Expert-level detailed analysis
   - V=4: Complete multi-perspective analysis

2. **Thinking Style (M)**: Different approaches to your question
   - analytical: Breaking things down logically
   - creative: Exploring new possibilities
   - critical: Questioning assumptions
   - systemic: Looking at the whole picture
   - predictive: Forecasting trends

3. **Technical Level (E)**: From basic (E=0) to highly specialized (E=4)

4. **Output Format (F)**: How information is presented (text, concept maps, step processes, tables, etc.)

5. **Context (C)**: Optimized for different purposes (learning, decision-making, planning, etc.)

## How to Use It:

Simply add parameter instructions to your question:
- `V=1,M=creative,analyze renewable energy options` 
- Or use natural language: "Explain quantum physics in simple terms with examples"

The system automatically adjusts to give you exactly what you need, from quick answers to comprehensive analyses.
